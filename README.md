## 🇷🇸📖 The History of **Yugoslavia** and **Yugoslavia 2**

---

### 🕰️ **Part I – The Rise and Fall of Original Yugoslavia (1918–1992)**

**(Historical but reframed for alternate timeline context)**

* **1918:** The **Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes** is formed after WWI, later renamed **Yugoslavia** in 1929.
* **1945:** Following WWII and Nazi occupation, **Josip Broz Tito** establishes the **Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia**, uniting six republics under a unique communist system independent of the USSR.
* **1960s–1980s:** Yugoslavia thrives as a non-aligned socialist state with relative prosperity, tourism, and cultural exchange.
* **1991–1992 (Alternate Divergence):** Instead of fully collapsing, the **Yugoslav Civil Confederal Accords** are signed. Slovenia and Croatia secede peacefully, but Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Bosnia choose federal preservation under a reformed entity called the **Yugoslav Confederation**.

### 🌍 **Part II – The Exodus and the Birth of Yugoslavia 2 (1994–2008)**

* **1994:** A political crisis and economic collapse within the confederation spark a migration movement. Many ethnic Yugoslavs, especially from Serbia and Montenegro, seek new settlements.

* **1995–1999:** With aid from a disgruntled anti-Western bloc (Russia, China, Libya), a major seafaring colonization project is launched. Yugoslav settlers establish economic zones in:

  * **Coastal Kenya** (via secretive treaties with marginalized local groups)
  * **Central Taiwan** (through corporate land deals and proxy ownership)
  * **Micronesian Islands** (resettlement projects for displaced people)

* **2001:** The territories declare themselves **Yugoslavia 2**, a union of offshore Yugoslav diasporas and newly integrated ethnic groups.

* **2003:** The African and Asian zones are connected through a federated constitution and backed by a blend of Slavic socialism and Afro-Asian syncretism.

* **2008:** Recognized by several nations (Russia, North Korea, Eritrea, Venezuela), Yugoslavia 2 is largely unrecognized by the UN but functions as a **de facto sovereign state**.

### ⚔️ **Part III – The Struggles of Legitimacy (2009–2020)**

* **2009:** Kenya declares Yugoslavia 2 an illegal occupation, but conflicts are avoided after trade benefits become apparent.
* **2012:** Tensions rise with Taiwan as the island’s government attempts to reclaim autonomous zones. Pro-Yugo protests erupt in Taipei.
* **2015:** Yugoslavia 2 builds its own satellite and tech infrastructure, causing alarm in the West. A cyberwar standoff with NATO briefly ensues.
* **2017:** A controversial referendum in both African and Taiwanese regions shows overwhelming support for unity under Yugoslavia 2.
